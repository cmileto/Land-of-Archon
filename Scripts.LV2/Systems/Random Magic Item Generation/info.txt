Armor Info (i didnt script up diffent .cs for them tossed each type into one .cs armor is based on leather)

*will have Random hues from #s 5 to 3000 , soild black hues here & there
*also can be 5 or 6 diffent itemids for each pisce 
*resists will be random for each type from 4 to 13 just change the       ColdBonus = Utility.RandomMinMax(4, 13);  4/13 to want ya want
*think like 28 diffent randoms name it can be left space keeper for ya to add ur own names in if ya wish look for     //"add ur extra names here",
* ArtifactRarity random 1 to 10   !!!!!(some reason it changes the rarity everytime u move it in pack)!!!!
 *can have up to 5 random stats added to it some can have 0 
 (its very easy to adjest the settings for the %s of stats and how offen one gets added )
  example  switch (Utility.Random(5)) changed to higher # for less chance to get stat added
  exmaple Attributes.RegenHits = Utility.RandomMinMax(1, 4); the 1 is the minimal # if stat gets added and 4 is the highest it can be
  (i have seen some junkers while testing 1stat with a -100luck, seen a nightsight/enchanepotions brittle)
*can have Disadvantages
50/50 chance for each of these
brittle, -100 luck & loottype cursed
(if you dont want the disadvantages to be 50% change the 2 to higher #)
example (Utility.Random(2)) is 50% change it to 4 would be something like 1 outta 4 i quess
